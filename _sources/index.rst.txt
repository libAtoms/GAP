GAP and SOAP documentation
==========================

.. module:: gap

These are the documentation pages for Gaussian Approximation Potential
(GAP) code. GAP is a plugin for QUIP, which is a set of molecular simulation
tools. QUIP itself can be used as a plugin to LAMMPS or called from ASE.

The purpose of the GAP code is to fit interatomic potentials and then
use them for molecular simulation.

**If you use the GAP code, please cite the original GAP paper:**

`"The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, without the Electrons",  Albert P. Bartók, Mike C. Payne, Risi Kondor, and Gábor Csányi. Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 136403 (2010)

**If you use the SOAP descriptor or kernel, please cite:**
